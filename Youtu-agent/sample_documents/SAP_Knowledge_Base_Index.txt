## Usage Instructions for RAG Chatbot

This knowledge base is designed to support an onboarding chatbot that can answer specific questions about company policies. The policies contain:

1. **Specific dollar amounts** (travel limits, stipends, budgets)
2. **Exact timeframes** (approval deadlines, response times, review cycles)  
3. **Contact information** (names, phone extensions, email addresses)
4. **System names** (SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Concur, Microsoft Teams, etc.)
5. **Detailed procedures** (step-by-step processes, approval workflows)
6. **Measurable metrics** (performance ratings, targets, limits)

When responding to queries, the chatbot should reference specific policy numbers, contact persons, dollar amounts, and procedures to demonstrate that information is being retrieved from the knowledge base rather than generated generically.
