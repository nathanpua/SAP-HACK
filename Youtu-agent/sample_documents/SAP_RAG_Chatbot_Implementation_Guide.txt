## üîß Technical Implementation Steps

### 1. Vector Database Setup
```python
# Recommended approach using popular vector database
import chromadb
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize embedding model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Create vector database
client = chromadb.Client()
collection = client.create_collection("sap_policies")

# Process and embed documents
sap_policy_files = [
    "SAP_Employee_Code_of_Conduct.txt",
    "SAP_Onboarding_SOP.txt", 
    "SAP_PTO_Leave_Policy.txt",
    "SAP_Travel_Expense_Policy.txt",
    "SAP_IT_Security_Policy.txt", 
    "SAP_Remote_Work_Policy.txt",
    "SAP_Performance_Management_Policy.txt"
]

for policy_file in sap_policy_files:
    with open(policy_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Split into chunks (recommended: 500-1000 characters)
    chunks = split_text(content, chunk_size=800, overlap=100)

    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        embedding = model.encode(chunk)
        collection.add(
            ids=[f"{policy_file}_chunk_{i}"],
            documents=[chunk],
            embeddings=[embedding],
            metadatas=[{"source": policy_file, "chunk_id": i}]
        )
```

### 2. RAG Pipeline Implementation
```python
def answer_question(question, top_k=5):
    # 1. Embed the question
    question_embedding = model.encode(question)

    # 2. Retrieve relevant chunks
    results = collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[question_embedding],
        n_results=top_k
    )

    # 3. Combine retrieved context
    context = "\n\n".join(results['documents'][0])

    # 4. Generate answer with LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    prompt = f"""
    You are SAP's onboarding assistant. Use the following company policy information to answer the employee's question accurately and specifically.

    Policy Information:
    {context}

    Employee Question: {question}

    Please provide a specific, helpful answer based on the policy information above. Include relevant policy numbers, contact information, dollar amounts, and procedures when applicable.
    """

    return llm_client.generate(prompt)
```

## üìû Questions About Implementation?

This knowledge base is specifically designed to make your RAG capabilities obvious and impressive. The highly detailed, specific information ensures that when your chatbot retrieves and uses this content, it's clear that it's not generating generic responses but pulling from a real, comprehensive knowledge base.

The SAP branding adds credibility and demonstrates enterprise-level thinking, while the consistent cross-references between policies show sophisticated knowledge management.

Good luck with your hackathon! üöÄ
