- **Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for performance and review tables
- **Views**: Pre-computed views for common AI agent queries

### Security Design

#### Access Control Architecture
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: PostgreSQL RLS policies ensuring users can only access their own data
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Hierarchical roles (Employee, Manager, HR, Admin) with specific permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Context-aware access decisions based on user attributes and data sensitivity
- **Zero Trust Model**: Every access request verified regardless of network location

#### Row Level Security Policies

##### Employee Data Access Policy
```sql
-- Enable RLS on employees table
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can only see their own employee record
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own employee record" ON employees
    FOR SELECT USING (auth_user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can update their own employee record
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own employee record" ON employees
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth_user_id = auth.uid());

-- HR can view all employee records
CREATE POLICY "HR can view all employee records" ON employees
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
            AND role = 'hr'
        )
    );
```

##### Department Data Access Policy
```sql
-- Enable RLS on departments table
ALTER TABLE departments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- All authenticated users can view department information
CREATE POLICY "All users can view department info" ON departments
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

-- Only HR and admins can modify department data
CREATE POLICY "HR and admins can modify departments" ON departments
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
            AND role IN ('hr', 'admin')
        )
    );
```
